This mod adds two empty characters. They have no cards or artifacts, so you can use them to make your own solo/duo runs. 
There is probably a better way to do this! But! I don't know enough about modding to try a more elegant solution.

You should know that they can show up in crystalized crew and gift from another timeline events.
Hey! If you're a CC modder, could you tell me how to stop that from happening?
Please.
...Because of that, you might want to remove them when you're not actively using them. Or not. I'm not your boss.
